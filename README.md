# Jaipur Air Quality Index

Creating a web application that displays the air quality index (AQI) for Jaipur, India, and deploying it on Google Cloud would involve several steps:

Collecting the data: The AQI data for Jaipur would need to be collected from a reliable source. This can be done by using an API provided by a government agency or a private organization.

Building the web application: The web application can be built using a web framework like Flask or Django and a frontend framework such as React or Angular. The application should display the AQI data in an easy-to-read format, and allow users to view the data for different locations or time periods.

Containerizing the application: The application should be containerized using a tool like Docker to make it easy to deploy on Google Cloud.

Deploying the application: The application can be deployed on Google Cloud using Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or App Engine. This would involve creating a cluster, deploying the containerized application, and creating a service to expose the application to the internet.

Storing the data: The data collected from the API should be stored in a database such as Cloud SQL or Bigtable, and the web application should be configured to query the data from the database.

Monitoring and scaling: The application should be monitored to ensure it is running smoothly, and scaling should be implemented to handle increased traffic.

It's worth noting that the above steps are just a general overview and the specific details of each step will depend on the complexity of the web application and the specific requirements.
